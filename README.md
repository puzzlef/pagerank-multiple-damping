Comparing performance of single vs block multiple damping factor based ranks for PageRank ([pull], [CSR]).

The **damping factor** parameter is the [PageRank algorithm] controls the tendency
of a user to follow one of the links on a given web page. A damping factor (Î±) of
`1` implies that the user (or a web surfer) will always follow one of the given
links on the given webpage (like a crawler bot). In contrast, a damping factor of
`0` implies that the user will always jump to a random webpage. A common choice for
damping factor is `0.85` which amounts to an average path (link follow) length of
`6.67`. This choice can make certain webpages seem too important, and leave the
remainder of the webpages with negligible importance. A prudent approach could be
to allow the average path length to vary from `2` to `10`, which amounts to the
damping factor parameter ranging from `0.50` to `0.90`.

*When* ranking vertices with **multiple different damping factors** is desireable,
the PageRank computation upon the graph can be peformed one after the other with
each desired damping factor (**single**), or with multiple damping factors in one
go (**block**). With the *block*-based approach, given `D` different damping factors,
each vertex in the graph is mapped to a list of `D` ranks. This is implemented as
a single-dimensional vector with a size of `N*D`, where `N` is the total number of
vertices in the graph. The idea behind such a *block*-based arrangement of ranks is
to allow for better usage of memory bandwidth by combining multiple accesses to the
graph data structure (in case of *single*-based approach) to one, and by increasing
the amount of sequential memory accesses into the rank vector (due to blocks of `D`
ranks per vertex).

Results indicate that there is significant overhead when running the *block*-based
approach with a *block size* of `1` (one damping factor only). This could be due to
the additional logic which for some reason prevents the compiler from being able to
optimize the code. However, with a *block size* of `32` (32 damping factors in
descending order), the *block*-based approach achieves an average speedup of `1.67x`
([GM-RATIO]) / `1.70x` ([AM-RATIO]) with respect to *single*-based approach.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input
data used for this experiment is available at the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection].
